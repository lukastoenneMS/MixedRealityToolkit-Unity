# [Template] Common build tasks shared between CI builds and PR validation.

steps:
# Build Standalone x86.
# This must happen before tests run, because if the build fails and tests attempt
# to get run, Unity will hang showing a dialog (even when in batch mode).
# This is the fastest build, since it doesn't produce an AppX.
- template: tasks/unitybuild.yml
  parameters:
    Arch: 'x86'
    Platform: 'Standalone'

# Tests should run earlier in the process, so that engineers can get test failure
# notifications earlier in the CI process.
